## Docker Stacks
This is a collection of Docker Compose configs that I use to setup stacks in my Portainer installtion.

- [**Frigate**](docker/frigate/README.md) - Security camera feed processing, archiving, and object identification.
- [**Manyfold**](docker/manyfold/README.md) - 3D-model inventory management. This is where I keep all the models (both 3rd-party and original) that I've printed previously and that I might want to print again in the future.
- [**Uptime Kuma**](docker/uptime-kuma/README.md) - Uptime monitoring.
